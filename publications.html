					<h4>Global Measurement of DNS Manipulation</h4>
					<div class="ref-links">
						<a class="pub-page">Webpage</a>
						<a class="pub-bibtex">BibTex</a>
					</div>
					<p class="authors">P. Pearce, B. Jones, F. Li, R. Ensafi, N. Feamster, V. Paxson</p>
					<p class="pub-in">In: USENIX Security, August 2017</p>
					<p class="abstract">Despite the pervasive nature of Internet censorship and the continuous evolution of how and where censorship is applied, measurements of censorship remain comparatively sparse. Understanding the scope, scale, and evolution of Internet censorship requires global measurements, performed at regular intervals. Unfortunately, the state of the art relies on techniques that, by and large, require users to directly participate in gathering these measurements, drastically limiting their coverage and inhibiting regular data collection. To facilitate large-scale measurements that can fill this gap in understanding, we develop Iris, a scalable, accurate, and ethical method to measure global manipulation of DNS solutions. Iris reveals widespread DNS manipulation of many domain names; our findings both confirm anecdotal or limited results from previous work and reveal new patterns in DNS manipulation.</p>

					<h4>A First Look into Transnational Routing Detours</h4>
					<div class="ref-links">
						<a class="pub-page">Webpage</a>
						<a class="pub-bibtex">BibTex</a>
					</div>
					<p class="authors">A. Edmundson, R. Ensafi, N. Feamster, and J. Rexford</p>
					<p class="pub-in">Position paper â€“ Poster &amp; Demo Session, 30th ACM SIGCOMM, August 2016</p>
					<p class="award">SIGCOMM Student Research Competition winner</p>
					<p class="abstract">An increasing number of countries are passing laws that facilitate the mass surveillance of their citizens. In response, governments and citizens are increasingly paying attention to the countries that their Internet traffic traverses. In some cases, countries are taking extreme steps, such as building new IXPs and encouraging local interconnection to keep local traffic local. We find that although many of these efforts are extensive, they are often futile, due to the inherent lack of hosting and route diversity for many popular sites. We investigate how the use of overlay network relays and the DNS open resolver infrastructure can prevent traffic from traversing certain jurisdictions.</p>
