						<p class="abstract">Despite the pervasive nature of Internet censorship and the continuous evolution of how and where censorship is applied, measurements of censorship remain comparatively sparse. Understanding the scope, scale, and evolution of Internet censorship requires global measurements, performed at regular intervals. Unfortunately, the state of the art relies on techniques that, by and large, require users to directly participate in gathering these measurements, drastically limiting their coverage and inhibiting regular data collection. To facilitate large-scale measurements that can fill this gap in understanding, we develop Iris, a scalable, accurate, and ethical method to measure global manipulation of DNS resolutions. Iris reveals widespread DNS manipulation of many domain names; our findings both confirm necdotal or limited results from previous work and reveal new patterns in DNS manipulation.</p></label>

						<p class="abstract">Being a volunteer-run, distributed anonymity network, Tor is vulnerable to Sybil attacks. Little is known about real-world Sybils in the Tor network, and we lack practical tools and methods to expose Sybil attacks. In this work, we develop sybilhunter, a system for detecting Sybil relays based on their appearance, such as configuration; and behavior, such as uptime sequences. We used sybilhunter’s diverse analysis techniques to analyze nine years of archived Tor network data, providing us with new insights into the operation of real-world attackers. Our findings include diverse Sybils, ranging from botnets, to academic research, and relays that hijacked Bitcoin transactions. Our work shows that existing Sybil defenses do not apply to Tor, it delivers insights into realworld attacks, and provides practical tools to uncover and characterize Sybils, making the network safer for its users.</p></label>

						<p class="abstract">An increasing number of countries are passing laws that facilitate the mass surveillance of their citizens. In response, governments and citizens are increasingly paying attention to the countries that their Internet traffic traverses. In some cases, countries are taking extreme steps, such as building new IXPs and encouraging local interconnection to keep local traffic local. We find that although many of these efforts are extensive, they are often futile, due to the inherent lack of hosting and route diversity for many popular sites. We investigate how the use of overlay network relays and the DNS open resolver infrastructure can prevent traffic from traversing certain jurisdictions.</p></label>

						<p class="abstract">Internet service providers are facing mounting pressure from regulatory agencies to increase the speed of their service offerings to consumers; some are beginning to deploy igabit-per-second speeds in certain markets, as well. The race to deploy increasingly faster speeds begs the question of whether users are exhausting the capacity that is already available. Previous work has shown that users who are already maximizing their usage on a given access link will continue to do so when they are migrated to a higher service tier. In a unique controlled experiment involving thousands of Comcast subscribers in the same city, we analyzed usage patterns of two groups: a control group (105 Mbps) and a randomly selected treatment group that was upgraded to 250 Mbps without their knowledge. We study how users who are already on service plans with high downstream throughput respond when they are upgraded to a higher service tier without their knowledge, as compared to a similar control group. To our surprise, the difference between traffic demands between both groups is higher for subscribers with moderate traffic demands, as compared to high-volume subscribers. We speculate that even though these users may not take advantage of the full available capacity, the service-tier increase generally improves performance, which causes them to use the Internet more than they otherwise would have.</p></label>

						<p class="abstract">Recently, the operators of the national censorship infrastructure of China began to employ “active probing” to detect and block the use of privacy tools. This probing works by passively onitoring the network for suspicious traffic, then actively probing the corresponding servers, and blocking any that are determined to run circumvention servers such as Tor. We draw upon multiple forms of measurements, some spanning years, to illuminate the nature of this probing. We identify the different types of probing, develop fingerprinting techniques to infer the physical structure of the system, localize the sensors that trigger probing—showing that they differ from the “Great Firewall” infrastructure—and assess probing’s efficacy in blocking different versions of Tor. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for designing circumvention servers that resist such probing mechanisms.</p></label>

						<p class="abstract">A nation-scale firewall, colloquially referred to as the “Great Firewall of China,” implements many different types of censorship and content filtering to control China’s Internet traffic. Past work has shown that the firewall occasionally fails. In other words, sometimes clients in China are able to reach blacklisted servers outside of China. This phenomenon has not yet been characterized because it is infeasible to find a large and geographically diverse set of clients in China from which to test connectivity. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by using a hybrid idle scan technique that is able to measure connectivity between a remote client and an arbitrary server, neither of which are under the control of the researcher performing measurements. In addition to hybrid idle scans, we present and employ a novel side channel in the Linux kernel’s SYN backlog. We show that both techniques are practical by measuring the reachability of the Tor network which is known to be blocked in China. Our measurements reveal that failures in the firewall occur throughout the entire country without any conspicuous geographical patterns. We give some evidence that routing plays a role, but other factors (such as how the GFW maintains its list of IP/port pairs to block) may also be important.</p></label>

						<p class="abstract">Side channels are channels of  implicit information flow that can be used to find out information that is not allowed to flow through explicit channels. This thesis focuses on network side channels, where information flow occurs in the TCP/IP network stack implementations of operating systems. I will describe three new  types of idle scans: a SYN backlog idle scan, a RST rate-limit idle scan, and a hybrid idle scan. Idle scans are special types of side channels that are designed to help someone performing a network measurement (typically an attacker or a researcher) to infer something about the network that they are not otherwise able to see from their vantage point.</p></label>

						<p class="abstract">Existing censorship  easurement platforms frequently suffer from poor adoption, insufficient geographic coverage, and scalability problems. In order to outline an analytical framework and data collection needs for future ubiquitous measurements initiatives, we build on top of the existent and widely-deployed RIPE Atlas platform. In particular, we propose methods for monitoring the reachability of vital services through an algorithm that balances timeliness, diversity, and cost. We then use Atlas to investigate blocking events in Turkey and Russia. Our measurements identify under-examined forms of interference and provide evidence of cooperation between a well-known blogging platform and government authorities for purposes of blocking hosted content.</p></label>

						<p class="abstract">Werewolves is an online  ersion of the game Werewolves of Miller’s Hollow that we developed in 2012 to help teach information flow in a computer security and privacy class. The game pits werewolves against townspeople in a shared Linux system, where students must use the command line environment to find information flow leaks in the form of side channels that reveal the werewolves’ identities. Werewolves has many desirable traits, such as the ability to make learning about information flow fun and the fact that the kinds of attacks students can carry out to gain an advantage in the game are open ended, which leads to self-guided learning. However, these benefits quickly deteriorate if one or two students dominate the game. In this paper, we discuss instances where this has occurred through several uses of the game, and propose ways to ameliorate this problem.</p></label>

						<p class="abstract">We describe a method for remotely detecting intentional packet drops on the Internet via side channel inferences. That is, given two arbitrary IP addresses on the Internet that meet some simple  equirements, our proposed technique can discover packet drops (e.g., due to censorship) between the two remote machines, as well as infer in which direction the packet drops are occurring. The only major requirements for our approach are a client with a global IP Identifier (IPID) and a target server with an open port. We require no special access to the client or server. Our method is robust to noise because we apply intervention analysis based on an autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) model. In a measurement study using our method featuring clients from multiple continents, we observed that, of all measured client connections to Tor directory servers that were censored, 98% of those were from China, and only 0.63% of measured client connections from China to Tor directory servers were not censored. This is congruent with current understandings about global Internet censorship, leading us to conclude that our method is effective.</p></label>

						<p class="abstract">Information flow is still relevant, from browser privacy to side-channel attacks on cryptography. However, many of the seminal ideas come from an era when multi-level secure systems were the main subject of study. Students have a hard time relating the material to today’s familiar commodity systems. We describe our experiences developing and utilizing an online version of the game Werewolves of Miller’s Hollow (a variant of Mafia). To avoid being eaten, students must exploit inference channels on a Linux system to discover “werewolves” among a population of “townspeople.” Because the werewolves must secretly discuss and vote about who they want to eat at night, they are forced to have some amount of keystroke and network activity in their remote shells at this time. In each instance of the game the werewolves are chosen at random from among the townspeople, creating an interesting dynamic where students must think about information flow from both perspectives and keep adapting their techniques and strategies throughout the semester. This game has engendered a great deal of enthusiasm among our students, and we have witnessed many interesting attacks that we did not anticipate. We plan to release the game under an open source software license.</p></label>

						<p class="abstract">Idle port scanning uses side-channel attacks to bounce scans off of a "zombie" host to stealthily scan a victim IP address or infer IP-based trust relationships between the zombie and victim. We present results from building a transition system model of a network protocol stack for an attacker, victim, and zombie, and testing this model for non-interference properties using model checking. Two new methods of idle scans resulted from our modeling effort, based on TCP RST rate limiting and SYN caches, respectively. Through experimental verification of these attacks, we show that it is possible to scan victims which the attacker is not able to route packets to, meaning that protected networks or ports closed by firewall rules can be scanned. This is not possible with the one currently known method of idle scan in the literature that is based on non-random IPIDs. For the future design of network protocols, a notion of trusted vs. untrusted networks and hosts (based on existing IP-based trust relationships) will enable shared, limited resources to be divided. For a model complex enough to capture the details of each attack and where a distinction between trusted and untrusted hosts can be made, we modeled RST rate limitations and a split SYN cache structure. Non-interference for these two resources was verified with symbolic model checking and bounded model checking to depth 1000, respectively. Because each transtion is roughly a packet, this demonstrates that the two respective idle scans are ameliorated by separating these resources.</p></label>
